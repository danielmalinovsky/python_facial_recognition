# python_facial_recognition
Repository for _the Facial Image Recognition_ project in Python within the course **Agile Project of Machine Learning Applications (4IZ563)** at Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, Prague University of Economics and Business (VÅ E). This course is being surpervised my the Data Scientists and ML Enginners at **CN Group CZ**.

_**Authors**_: [Daniel Malinovsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-malinovsky-88b162198) (_Team Leader_), [Petr Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petr-ngn) (_Lead Data Scientist_), [Petr Hollmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petr-hollmann-3583aa208), [Roman Pavlata](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-pavlata-a3b602161)

_**Deliverable**_: Face Recognition & Detection tool implemented in Python
- Business and Organizational tasks (Backlogs and estimates)
- Agile Development in Machine Learning
- Other tasks (Presentations of sprints, regular communication with the Product Owners, SCRUM practices)
